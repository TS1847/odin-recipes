	<h2>Easy, simple, homemade pizza</h2>
		<p>Most people think you can't make great pizza at home. Well they're mostly right. Really good, crispy pizza requires an oven that gets really hot. But... one thing you can do is use a cast iron skillet, because those things get hot as shit. The shape of a standard cast iron skillet also works well to give your homemade pie a good shape... you know... round.</p>
